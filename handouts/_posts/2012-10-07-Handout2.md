title: Getting Started Todo App Handout 2
category: handout
abstract: This handout will help guide you through building your application with Backbone and Backbone.Marionette.

###Lets Start building the Todo App!

- When you start to think about the todo application, how can you break it up into pieces?

  Lets start with the Todo's simplest part, its data Model.

  ###Todo Backbone Model

  Start By Opening `Todo.js` from `/js/models`

  In `Todo.js` we will want to require (define) backbone so you may extend its model
  Backbone's model can have default's, so lets create a completed default to track its state.
  There should also be a title, and a created time.

  <pre>
    <code>define(['backbone'],function(Backbone){
      'use strict';

      return Backbone.Model.extend({
        defaults: {
          title     : '',
          completed : false,
          created   : 0
        }
      });
    });</code></pre>

  Now that we have our model, lets move on to the pieces that reflect these data models.

###Marionette Views

- What kind of views would we need to make up a Todo?

  ####ItemView

     We have the Todo Item View, for displaying the todo.

     Before we create any views we will want to set up our templates modules

     Create `templates.js` in `/js` and place an empty define block inside

      define(function(require){
         "use strict";
        return {
            /* name : require('tpl!templates/xxxx.tmpl') */
         };
       });

     Okay back to the **ItemView**

     Lets Create `TodoItemView.js` in `/js/views`

     In `TodoItemView.js` we will want to require Marionette this time and extend its ItemView.

  <pre>
    <code>define(['marionette','templates'], function (Marionette,templates) {
        "use strict";

        return Marionette.ItemView.extend({

          template : templates.todoItemView,

          tagName : 'li',

          initialize : function() {
            this.bindTo(this.model, 'change', this.render, this);
          },

          destroy : function() {
            this.model.destroy();
          }
       });
      });</code></pre>

    Backbone views are used to reflect what your applications' data models look like.

    Notice how we defined a template and required our templates that we haven't created yet.

    We see here that we have a **bindTo** call on the model's change state. This will call the **render** method which is internal to Backbone's View.

    Passing the local `this` context when the call is made.

    We also define the **destroy** method to get rid of the model. We will play more with that later.


- Now that we have our ItemView, what else do we need?


    ####CompositeView

    We will also need a Composite View.

    The Composite View combines an ItemView and a CollectionView allowing you to display collections of Items easily.
    (Usually Used for rendering a branch-leaf, hierarchical structure)

    This `CompositeView.js` should also live in `/js/views`

  <pre>
    <code> define(['marionette','templates','views/TodoItemView'], function (Marionette,templates,ItemView) {
        "use strict";

        return Marionette.CompositeView.extend({

          template : templates.todosCompositeView,

          itemView : ItemView,

          itemViewContainer : '#todo-list'

        });
    });</code></pre>

  Here we define another template (* create todosCompositeView.tmpl and require it in template.js), the Todo Item View, and the container for the itemView's. We call it #todo-list.

  Now that we have the views out of the way, lets create the todo collection

###Backbone Collection

  We will need a way to keep track of a List of Todos.

  Lets Open `TodoCollection.js` from `/js/collections`

<pre>
  <code> define(['backbone','models/Todo'],function(Backbone,Todo) {
     'use strict';

     return Backbone.Collection.extend({

       model: Todo,

       comparator: function( todo ) {
         return todo.get('created');
       }
     });
   });</code></pre>

   Here we require and attach the Todo Model, we also override the comparator method which is used to maintain the collection in sorted order.

   We want to sort the Todo's by their created date when we `fetch` the collection.

###Marionette.Application

  - We will want to Open `app.js` from `/js`

  This will instantiate the new marionette application, attach the main app regions, and fetch the list of todos. Centralizing our application logic.

  The `addInitializer` method allows us to perform special tasks when the application is started using (app.start())

<pre>
  <code>define(['marionette','collections/TodoCollection','views/TodoListCompositeView'],
  function(Marionette, TodoCollection, TodoListCompositeView){
    "use strict";

    var app = new Marionette.Application(),
        todoCollection = new TodoCollection();

    app.addRegions({
      header : '#header',
      main   : '#main',
      footer : '#footer'
    });

    app.addInitializer(function(){
      var viewOptions = {
        collection : todoCollection
      };

      app.main.show(new TodoListCompositeView(viewOptions));

      todoList.fetch();
    });

    return app;
  });</code></pre>


This application module can be started in `main.js`, the first entry into our application. Require `app` and call app.start()

###The App Module, The Model, Its Collection and Its Views have been built, What's left?

- Integration of localStorage (for todo persistence)

- Basic routing (Marionette.AppRouter)

- A HeaderView so we can create todos

- A FooterView so we can display the todo stats

These last three pieces should be easy with the knowledge from above and of course docs...
